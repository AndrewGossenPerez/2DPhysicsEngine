2D Physics Engine I've been developing using OpenGL. Set up to work on Polygon-Polygon.

NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- Friction
- Spatial partioning
  
TODO (Correctness
- Fix restitution application so bounce is consistent for all collisions, not only cases with significant angular impulse.

TODO (Performance):
- Add shape-specific collision paths (Circle–Circle, Circle–Polygon, Box–Box) instead of treating everything as generic polygons.
